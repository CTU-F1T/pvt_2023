# TODO: stage_ros2 when interval_sim is set to a value lower than 100.
#   The ymd-stella/stage_ros2 (rev a1158e3db70440e82cf18e2b477a48d15bc2c36e) crashes when interval_sim is set to a value lower than 100.
#   It seems that the problem is caused by accessing recently-freed memory. Publishing if camara image data happens asynchronously but the array that is freed in the next iteration of the simulation.
#   If the interval_sim >= 100, the above-described situation does not occur (because publishing is done fast enough).
#   If we comment out the camera code in stage_ros2, everything works.
#   We might fork stage_ros2, fix it (either by disable camera plugin, or fix the root cause), and use our fork.
